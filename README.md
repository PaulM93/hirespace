# Hirespace Front end Tech test

Provided in this repository should be all the files required in order to get started with the front-end tech test for Hirespace. 

Clone this repository. From there you are free to build this project in anyway you want. Feel free to use frameworks, libraries or anything you think would assist you in the development of the task.

Aim to spend around 2 hours at most on the project but there is no strict time limit. The end result does not need to be production ready but should be representative of your work.


## **The task**

![Page layout](Ask_Expert_Example.png)

Above you should see a one page design (Ask_Expert_Example.png if not displayed). The task is to recreate this page in HTML / CSS / Javascript. It's advisable you use a framework to assist you with this; but is not strictly required.

Some images have been provided, although many can be achieved easier via styling - use them as you feel required to help with the task.

Take into consideration the different types of resolutions which could access such a page and have the page adapt in the best way you see how.

The form itself should not do anything but output it's content to the console when clicking the "Next" button.

### **Stepper**

(Event details - (2) Event date / time - (3) Contact details) Does not need implementing, you may include the elements in your page but it does not need to switch to a different page or have any funcitonality.
